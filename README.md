# TACS_effects_network
We investigated the effects of tACS intensities and frequencies on computational neuronal network model of two-compartment neurons.

## Information about the cell model used

## Software requirements and instructions
The data were generated using NEURON Environment 8.0.0. You can download this software here https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/. 
Assuming NEURON has been installed, the MOD files in the 'mod/' folder need to be compiled using mknrndll. Copy then nrnmech.dll from 'mod/' up one level to the main folder.
